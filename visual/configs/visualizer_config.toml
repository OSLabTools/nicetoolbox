###### Setup Rerun Display Windows #####
### You can configure which data will be shown in which rerun window
### by changing the media.component.canvas items
### The keys, i.e., '3d' or '2d_interpolated', are the name of the data provided by that component.
### The lists define which canvases (rerun windows) will show this data:
### '3D_Canvas': the data will be visualised in 3D canvas. It can be created only for multi-view datasets. (don't change the canvas's name)
### cameras: the data will be visualized on that camera image. The name of camera has to be same as the camera folder (alsogiven in dataset_properties.toml)
### metrics - shows the data on plot
### empty list: the data will not visualized

### algorithms parameter under media.component define which algorithms will be displayed.
## In case there are multiple algorithms, such as hrnetw48 and vitpose in body_joints component,
## you can define which algorithm results will be shown.
## type both algorithm names if you want to see both of them.
