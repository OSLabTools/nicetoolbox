# Include a dataset with multiple camera views

This tutorial builds up on the tutorial [Include a dataset with a single camera view](tutorial1_dataset_single_view.md) which explains how to run the NICE Toolbox on datasets that contain videos of a single camera, without multi-view captures. This follow-up tutorial now adds instructions specific for multiple calibrated cameras.
