    Logs the configurations to a file.

    The function takes in a dictionary of configurations, an output folder path, and an optional
    file name. It fills in placeholders in the code_config dictionary with actual values using 
    the config_fill_auto function. Then, it constructs the log file path by joining the output 
    folder path and the file name with a .toml extension. After that, it updates the configs 
    dictionary with the filled code_config and saves the configurations to the log file using the
    save_config function.
